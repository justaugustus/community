SIG-PM (Program, Product, Project Management)
=============================================

### Overview:

Program, project, and product management in open source software communities represents a significant challenge. Such positions traditionally rely on hierarchical structure to drive work from the executive tier down to the team level, whereas in OSS there is little or no accountability other than that gained through influence and commutative trust.

### TL;DR:

#### We cannot:

-	Set schedules

-	Dictate features to SIGs

-	Set headcount

#### We can and must

-	Serve the individuals and companies within the Kubernetes community by communicating the value produced by the SIGs

In this milieu, the art of program-level facilitation requires an observational approach that gathers information as opposed to driving it. The “program” in question is essentially the assembly of a coherent view of aggregate plans, processes, governance, and aspirations.
